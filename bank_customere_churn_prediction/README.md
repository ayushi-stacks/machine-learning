# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., leave the bank) based on various features such as credit score, age, balance, and number of products used. The model is built using machine learning algorithms and evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue in many industries, including banking. This project uses various machine learning techniques to predict whether a bank customer will churn based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features about bank customers such as:
- CreditScore
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Estimated Salary
- Geography
- Gender

Target variable:
- **Exited**: Indicates whether the customer churned or not (1 = churned, 0 = stayed).

## Requirements
- ``Python 3.x``
- ``Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab``
- Libraries:
  - ``NumPy``
  - ``pandas``
  - ``scikit-learn``
  - ``matplotlib``
  - ``seaborn``
