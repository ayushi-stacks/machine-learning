# Mileage Prediction Using Regression Analysis

This project uses regression analysis to predict car mileage (Miles Per Gallon - MPG) based on various vehicle features such as cylinders, horsepower, and weight.

## Overview

The notebook, `mileage_prediction(regression_analysis).ipynb`, contains all the necessary steps to preprocess the dataset, visualize relationships between features, train a regression model to predict MPG, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset includes features like:
- **mpg**: Miles per gallon
- **cylinders**: Number of cylinders
- **displacement**: Engine displacement (in cubic inches)
- **horsepower**: Engine horsepower
- **weight**: Vehicle weight (in pounds)
- **acceleration**: Time to reach 60mph (in seconds)
- **model_year**: Year of the car model
- **origin**: Country of origin
- **name**: Car name
